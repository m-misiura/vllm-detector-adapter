# This Dockerfile is designed to deliver vllm-detector-adapter
# in a tiny image only containing this app + any additional required
# packages. (At the time of writing, there are no additional packages required)
# NOTE: The image generated out of this file should only be used in conjunction with a
# compatible vllm image, otherwise it will throw error.

# directly. So we need to use the `.` operator and to be able to do that, we need to run install script

# NOTE: Along with this, one may need to adjust PYTHONPATH to call
# this package, depending on setup.
# Example: PYTHONPATH='${SHARED_PACKAGE_PATH}:${PYTHONPATH}'
